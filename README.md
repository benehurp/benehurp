## <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"> Hi, I'm Bene-Hur
I am a Front-End Engineer with extensive experience in fundamental technologies, including HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

My specialization lies in developing interfaces using React.js, preferably with Next.js. Furthermore, I have solid knowledge that allows me to create microservices both in Node.js with Express or Fastify, and in Java with Spring Boot, allowing me to act in a versatile way as a FullStack Developer.

In my most recent position, I held the position of Technical Lead on a project focused on the commercial aviation sector, where I led a team of developers in developing highly responsive, event-driven interfaces in real time.

My experience is not just limited to this sector; I have also accumulated significant knowledge and experience in logistics systems, financial systems and e-commerce systems throughout my career.
